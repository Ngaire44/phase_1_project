    "1. Which aircraft make are least frequently involved in accidents\n",
    "    This helps decide on the make or manufacturers(amateur built)\n",
    "2. What are the most common causes of aviation accidents\n",
    "    This helps to understand risk trends, are newer models safer than older one\n",
    "3. What percentage of accidents are survivable and what factors influence survivability?\n",
    "    Here, we will check on engines, weather\n",
    "4. How do accident rates vary by operator type (commercial vs private)\n",
    "    This help to decide the aviation sector to indulge in\n",
    "5. Are there seasonal patterns in aviation accidents\n",
    "    This helps comin weather contingency planning\n",
    "6. What factors contribute to fatal accidents(weather, broad phase of flight)\n",
    "    Helps decide on aircraft specs"

    "Missing Value Handling, Drop columns with excessive missing data, Impute missing values using appropriate statistical or categorical strategies, Data Filtering,\n",
    "Remove irrelevant or incomplete records (e.g. non-aircraft incidents or missing key variables), Categorical Grouping, Group low-frequency entries under broader labels (e.g. \"Other\"), Data Type Correction, Convert date columns to proper datetime format, Ensure numerical columns were correctly typed for analysis, and\n",
