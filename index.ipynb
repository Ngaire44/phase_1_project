    "1. Which aircraft make are least frequently involved in accidents\n",
    "    This helps decide on the make or manufacturers(amateur built)\n",
    "2. What are the most common causes of aviation accidents\n",
    "    This helps to understand risk trends, are newer models safer than older one\n",
    "3. What percentage of accidents are survivable and what factors influence survivability?\n",
    "    Here, we willl check on engines, weather\n",
    "4. How do accident rates vary by operator type (commercial vs private)\n",
    "    This help to decide the aviation sector to indulge in\n",
    "5. Are there seasonal patterns in aviation accidents\n",
    "    This helps comin weather contingency planning\n",
